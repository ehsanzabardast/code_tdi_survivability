**Authors:** Ehsan Zabardast - Kwabena Ebo Bennin - Javier Gonzalez Huerta

### Overview:

This package contains the scripts used to conduct the study in the paper <em>Further Investigation of the Survivability of Code Technical Debt Items</em> submitted to the Journal of Systems and Software.

Specifically, the package includes the following:

* The <code>R</code> scripts used to pre-process the raw data extracted from SonarQube.
* The <code>R</code> scripts used to perform the survival analysis.
* The pre-processed data from 3 open-source systems that we analyzed in the paper.

The raw data is available at: [http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3723538](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3723538)
